# Graphs-trees
Finding maximum depth in a binary tree and finding shortest path using BFS in a graph. Detailed description of the problem can be found in the PDF file in this folder.

The binary trees implementation uses recursion to construct the tree and find the maximum depth of the tree. 

The graphs implementation has big input files with millions of numbers. The algorithm finds the shortest path in less than a second for each case. I'm using 2 dimensional vectors, thanks to the vector template in the standard library.
